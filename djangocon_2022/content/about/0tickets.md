**The following ticket types are available:**  
  
  
**Student Ticket (€69) -** If you are currently enrolled as a full-time student or if you are currently without regular income. This ticket does not cover our costs for the conference, but we’ll be able to provide it to you thanks to other people paying more for their ticket than the minimal prices. 
  
**Individual Ticket (€119) -** If you are paying your ticket from your personal money and are not being reimbursed by your employer. 

**Business Ticket (€179) -** If your employer is paying for the ticket or reimbursing you for your conference expenses. 

**CONTRIBUTOR Ticket (€299) -** The additional money from this ticket type ensure we can afford offering cheaper tickets to students and other people who could not afford to join otherwise. Thank you for doing so! As a token of appreciation, your name will be eternalized in the official DjangoCon Europe 2021 webpage (upon your authorization); and, you will also receive a free Django t-shirt!
